# Installing go-keyring

Learn how to add go-keyring to your Go project using standard Go tools. This guide covers installation commands, version notes, and platform-specific caveats so you can set up confidently.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & Supported Platforms

Before installing go-keyring, ensure your environment meets the following prerequisites:

- **Supported Operating Systems:**
  - macOS
  - Linux and BSD (with DBus and Secret Service API support, e.g., GNOME Keyring)
  - Windows

- **System Dependencies:**
  - macOS: The `/usr/bin/security` binary must be available (default on macOS).
  - Linux/BSD: Secret Service DBus interface, typically provided by GNOME Keyring.
    - Make sure the default `login` keyring exists. If not, create one with tools like Seahorse.
  - Windows: Uses Windows Credential Manager; no extra dependencies needed.

- **Go Environment:**
  - Go modules enabled or GOPATH setup.
  - Compatible Go version (generally Go 1.13+ recommended).

- **Network:**
  - No special network access required for installing or running go-keyring.

<Tip>
If you are on Linux/BSD and do not have the `login` collection in your keyring, create it using Seahorse:

1. Open Seahorse.
2. Select **File > New > Password Keyring**.
3. Name the keyring **login**.
4. Save and restart your session if necessary.
</Tip>

## 2. Installation Instructions

Adding go-keyring to your Go project is straightforward using the `go get` command.

### Step 1: Add the go-keyring module

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
// For Go modules enabled
go get github.com/zalando/go-keyring@latest
```

This fetches the latest version of go-keyring and adds it to your project's `go.mod` file.

### Step 2: Verify installation

Run the following command to confirm the module is correctly downloaded:

```bash
go list -m github.com/zalando/go-keyring
```

Expected output:

```
github.com/zalando/go-keyring vX.Y.Z
```

where `vX.Y.Z` is the installed version number.

<Tip>
Use `go get github.com/zalando/go-keyring@vX.Y.Z` to install a specific version if needed.
</Tip>

### Common Pitfall

Ensure your Go environment supports modules (`GO111MODULE=on`) or you are in a module-enabled workspace to avoid dependency resolution issues.

---

## 3. Platform-Specific Considerations

### macOS

- Uses the native OS X Keychain through the `/usr/bin/security` command.
- Passwords are encoded in base64 to avoid corruption of multi-line or non-ASCII data.
- Data size limits: Combined service, username, and password should not exceed approximately 3000 bytes.

### Linux / BSD

- Uses Secret Service DBus interface backing onto system keyring implementations like GNOME Keyring.
- Requires an active DBus session and the default `login` keyring.
- There are no strict size limits but storing extremely large secrets (>100KiB) can degrade performance.

### Windows

- Uses Windows Credential Manager via the Windows API.
- Passwords limited to 2560 bytes.
- Service names limited to approximately 30 KB (with practical limits below that).

<Warning>
If your data exceeds platform limits, the `Set` operation will return an error `ErrSetDataTooBig`. Adjust your secret size accordingly.
</Warning>

## 4. Example: Adding go-keyring and Setting Your First Secret

Create a simple Go program to test go-keyring installation:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "github.com/zalando/go-keyring"
)

func main() {
    service := "my-app"
    user := "example-user"
    password := "super-secret-password"

    // Store the secret
    if err := keyring.Set(service, user, password); err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to set secret: %v", err)
    }

    // Retrieve the secret
    secret, err := keyring.Get(service, user)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to get secret: %v", err)
    }

    fmt.Printf("Retrieved secret: %s\n", secret)
}
```

Build and run your program:

```bash
go run main.go
```

Expected output:

```
Retrieved secret: super-secret-password
```

## 5. Verification & Common Troubleshooting

### Verification Steps

1. Run your test program as above to confirm successful `Set` and `Get` operations.
2. Check for any error messages indicating missing dependencies or permission issues.

### Troubleshooting Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Solutions">
<Accordion title="Set Data Too Big Error">

If you receive an `ErrSetDataTooBig` error:

- Ensure your password and combined data length respects platform limits (refer to section 3).
- Try reducing secret length or splitting data.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing Keyring or DBus Session on Linux">

- Confirm GNOME Keyring or alternative Secret Service DBus provider is running.
- Ensure DBus session bus is active (`echo $DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`).
- If missing, start your keyring daemon or re-login.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Operation Not Found Errors">

- Verify you have access permissions to the system keyring.
- On macOS, ensure your user keychain is unlocked.
- On Windows, verify your user credentials allow access.

</Accordion>
