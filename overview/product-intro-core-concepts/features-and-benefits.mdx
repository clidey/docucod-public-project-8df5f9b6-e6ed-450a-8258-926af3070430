# Core Features & Benefits of go-keyring

## Unlock Seamless, Secure Credential Management Across Platforms

go-keyring offers developers a unified, hassle-free way to store, retrieve, and manage secrets locally using the native OS keyring services on **macOS**, **Linux/BSD**, and **Windows**. This cross-platform approach ensures your applications can securely handle sensitive credentials without forcing users to re-authenticate repeatedly or rely on custom encryption solutions.

### Why go-keyring? Key Benefits at a Glance
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Write your secret management code once and run it anywhere—macOS (using the system keychain), Linux/BSD (via DBus and GNOME Keyring), and Windows (with Credential Manager) are fully supported.
- **Statically Linked Binary Friendly:** Unlike many libraries relying on C bindings, go-keyring is built to be friendly to statically linked Go binaries, simplifying deployment and avoiding common runtime dependencies.
- **Simple, Intuitive API:** Focus on what matters—storing and retrieving secrets—using an easy-to-understand API that abstracts away platform-specific complexity.
- **Native Security:** Secrets are stored using the system’s trusted secure storage, leveraging OS-level protections and user authentication, eliminating the need to reinvent security mechanisms.
- **Flexible Secret Operations:** Beyond basic set/get, the library supports deleting individual secrets or purging all secrets for a service, providing full control over stored credentials.

## Core Features Explained

### 1. Cross-Platform Secret Storage
- **macOS:** Interacts with the native keychain via the built-in `/usr/bin/security` command, securely handling secrets with automatic base64 encoding for complex or multiline data.
- **Linux/BSD:** Uses the Secret Service API over DBus (commonly GNOME Keyring) to store and manage secrets in a centralized, encrypted keyring.
- **Windows:** Integrates with Windows Credential Manager, storing secrets safely and ensuring compliance with platform size and security limits.

> This native integration means secrets are protected leveraging the OS’s strongest security capabilities instead of relying on custom encryption.

### 2. Simple Yet Powerful API
- **Set(service, user, password):** Store a secret linked to a service and user.
- **Get(service, user):** Retrieve the secret securely.
- **Delete(service, user):** Remove a specific secret.
- **DeleteAll(service):** Wipe all secrets for a given service key.

#### Example: Basic Set and Get
```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "github.com/zalando/go-keyring"
)

func main() {
    service := "my-app"
    user := "alice"
    password := "s3cr3tP@ssw0rd"

    // Store the secret securely
    if err := keyring.Set(service, user, password); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    // Retrieve it anywhere it's needed
    secret, err := keyring.Get(service, user)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    log.Printf("Retrieved secret: %s", secret)
}
```

### 3. Secure Handling of Complex Secrets
The library automatically encodes multiline or non-ASCII passwords (e.g., base64 on macOS), ensuring secrets are reliably stored and retrieved without corruption, regardless of content.

### 4. Robust Delete Operations
Remove secrets individually or bulk-delete all credentials for a service, enabling secure clean-up of sensitive data during logout flow or credential rotation.

### 5. Support for Mocking and Testing
A built-in mock provider lets you simulate keyring behavior in tests without requiring access to a real keyring environment, significantly easing CI/CD and local validation.

## Real-World Benefits and Use Cases

### Eliminate Re-Authentication Hassles
If your CLI or GUI application interacts with APIs that require credentials, use go-keyring to remember authenticated sessions securely and silently, avoiding repeated password prompts.

### Simplified Development & Deployment
No need to write platform-specific secret storage logic or bundle complex dependencies; go-keyring’s clean API and static binary support let you focus on delivering features.

### Protect Sensitive User Data Locally
By leveraging native OS secure storage, users’ secrets never leave their machines unprotected, lowering your risk in data breaches and compliance requirements.

### Support for a Wide Range of Applications
From command-line tools to desktop apps and scripts, go-keyring fits into any workflow that needs local secret management with minimal friction.

## Best Practices and Tips

- **Service Naming:** Use consistent and descriptive service names to categorize secrets logically (e.g., `myapp-auth`, `myapp-db`).
- **User Identifiers:** Clearly define user strings if you support multiple identities per service.
- **Secret Size Limits:** Avoid excessively large secrets; macOS and Windows platforms enforce data size limits (e.g., Windows passwords capped at 2560 bytes).
- **Unlock Keyrings Before Use:** On Linux/BSD, ensure the default `login` keyring exists and is unlocked, typically managed via your desktop environment.
- **Handle ErrNotFound Gracefully:** Operations like `Get` and `Delete` return this error if secrets don’t exist—plan your app’s logic accordingly.

<Warning>
Attempting to store oversized secrets on macOS or Windows will result in an error. Design your credentials or tokens to fit within these platform limits.
</Warning>

<Tip>
In automated tests, initialize the mock provider with `keyring.MockInit()` to seamlessly test secret operations without external dependencies.

## Underlying Workflow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is Secret Already Stored?}
    B -- No --> C[Call keyring.Set(service, user, password)]
    B -- Yes --> D[Call keyring.Get(service, user)]
    D --> E{Use Secret in Your Application}
    C --> E
    E --> F{Need to Delete Secret?}
    F -- Yes --> G[Call keyring.Delete(service, user)]
    F -- No --> H[Continue Normal Execution]
    G --> H
```

This straightforward flow highlights how go-keyring fits naturally into any credential lifecycle.
