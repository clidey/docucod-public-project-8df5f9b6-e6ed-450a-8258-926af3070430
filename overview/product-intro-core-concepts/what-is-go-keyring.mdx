# What is go-keyring?

## Unlock Seamless, Secure Credential Management Across Platforms

go-keyring is a powerful, OS-agnostic Go library designed to let you securely store, retrieve, and delete sensitive information like passwords directly in your system's native keyring. Rather than inventing a new storage solution, it seamlessly integrates with the underlying platform’s official credential storage mechanisms, providing a consistent and trustworthy way to manage secrets across macOS, Linux/BSD, and Windows.

## Why go-keyring Matters

Imagine building a CLI tool or application needing to authenticate users but avoiding the hassle and risk of repeatedly prompting for credentials. Instead of relying on environment variables or unprotected local files, go-keyring empowers your software to tap into the secure, encrypted credentials vault already provided by operating systems — in turn, enhancing security and improving user convenience.

### Key Benefits at a Glance
- **Cross-Platform Consistency:** Uniform API for macOS, Linux/BSD, and Windows keyrings, abstracting away platform quirks.
- **Native Security:** Utilizes the OS’s secure storage, minimizing the risk of exposing credentials.
- **Developer Simplicity:** Minimal dependencies and straightforward API design for easy integration.
- **Lightweight & Dependency-Free:** Avoids cumbersome C bindings and complex native dependencies.

### Who Should Use go-keyring?
- Developers building CLI tools or desktop apps requiring local credential storage.
- Teams aiming for secure, native key-based authentication flows.
- Projects targeting multiple operating systems without rewriting credential management code.

## What is go-keyring?

go-keyring is a Go library that provides an easy, standardized interface to interact with system-level keyring services. These keyring services securely save secrets such as passwords, tokens, or API keys in encrypted vaults managed by the operating system.

By offering methods to set, get, and delete secrets tied to specific service and username pairs, go-keyring abstracts the underlying differences between native keychain implementations on macOS, the Secret Service DBus interface on Linux/BSD, and the Windows Credential Manager.

## Solving the Credential Storage Problem

Storing secrets securely on a user's machine is critical yet complex due to differing platform APIs, formats, and security practices. Manually handling credentials risks leaks, requires additional encryption layers, and adds complexity.

go-keyring solves this by:
- **Abstracting platform-specific details** so you write uniform code.
- **Delegating security management** to the native system, which has proven, audited implementations with user-level encryption safeguards.
- **Handling common pitfalls** like multiline secrets and maximum data size limitations.

This makes it ideal for CLI applications that need to authenticate with remote services without repeatedly prompting for user input or insecurely caching credentials.

## What Makes go-keyring Unique?

- **OS-Agnostic Elegance:** Supports macOS keychain, Linux/BSD Secret Service, and Windows Credential Manager with the same API.
- **No C Bindings:** Unlike many other keyring libraries, go-keyring avoids C dependencies, improving binary portability.
- **Mockable for Testing:** Provides an in-memory mock keyring to enable easy unit testing without platform dependencies.
- **Clear Error Handling:** Returns explicit errors when data is missing or too large, enabling predictable workflows.

## How Does It Work at a High Level?

Rather than reinventing the wheel, go-keyring dynamically delegates secret storage operations to a platform-specific provider:

- On **macOS**, it uses the `/usr/bin/security` command-line tool to communicate with the system keychain.
- On **Linux and BSD**, it interfaces with the Secret Service API over DBus (commonly backed by GNOME Keyring or other compatible services).
- On **Windows**, it utilizes the Windows Credential Manager APIs via a Go wrapper.

Your Go code calls simple functions like `Set(service, user, password)`, and go-keyring handles the rest under the hood, ensuring secure, native storage of credentials.

<CodeGroup>
```go
// Setting a secret
err := keyring.Set("myapp", "alice", "supersecret")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Retrieving a secret
secret, err := keyring.Get("myapp", "alice")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
fmt.Println("Retrieved secret:", secret)
```
</CodeGroup>

By using go-keyring, you ensure your app treats user secrets with the same security and care as the platform itself does.

## Practical Example: Simplifying CLI Authentication

Picture a command-line tool that connects to a remote API using basic authentication. Without go-keyring, users might need to supply credentials every time or store them insecurely in plain text.

With go-keyring:

1. **User authenticates once,** the tool saves credentials securely in the OS keyring.
2. **Next time, the tool reads credentials silently** from the keyring, eliminating repeated prompts.
3. **Credentials are never exposed in environment variables or logs.**

This flow improves user experience while maintaining high security integrity.
