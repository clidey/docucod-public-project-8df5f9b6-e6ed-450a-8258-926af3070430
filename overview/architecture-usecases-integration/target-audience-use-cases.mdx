# Target Audience & Typical Use Cases

Unlocking the power of secure local storage for sensitive data is essential for many developers. This page guides you through who benefits most from go-keyring and reveals practical scenarios where it delivers significant value. Whether you’re creating command-line tools, desktop applications, or system utilities, understanding these use cases will help you apply go-keyring confidently and effectively.

---

## Who Is go-keyring For?

### CLI Developers
Building command-line interfaces that interact with APIs or services often requires handling user credentials securely. go-keyring enables CLI developers to seamlessly store and retrieve credentials locally without prompting users repeatedly.


### Desktop Application Developers
If you're developing desktop apps that need to manage user passwords, tokens, or API keys, go-keyring integrates with native OS keyrings to provide a consistent, secure way to handle secrets that leverages the user's existing security framework.


### System Tool and Utility Authors
Tools that run on a system level or require protected access to credentials—such as automation scripts, backup tools, or system monitors—can use go-keyring to manage secrets securely and transparently.


---

## Typical Use Cases

### 1. Storing API Credentials Locally
Imagine building a CLI client for a cloud service that requires authentication. Instead of forcing users to enter their credentials every time, you can use go-keyring to securely save tokens or passwords locally.

**Benefit:** Smooth user experience by automating credential retrieval while keeping secrets encrypted and safe.

```go
service := "api-cli-tool"
user := "user@example.com"
password := "user-secret-token"

// Save credentials
err := keyring.Set(service, user, password)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Retrieve credentials on subsequent CLI calls
storedToken, err := keyring.Get(service, user)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Use 'storedToken' to authenticate requests
```

---

### 2. Local User Authentication Storage
Desktop apps that require login functionality benefit from storing passwords or session tokens separately from the app’s code.

**Benefit:** Keeps authentication data safe from leaks and makes session management more convenient.

---

### 3. Securing OAuth Tokens
Applications that use OAuth can store refresh tokens and access tokens securely with go-keyring, reducing the risk of token theft or misuse.

**Benefit:** Enables seamless re-authentication flows without exposing sensitive tokens in plain files or environment variables.

---

### 4. Automated Scripts and Daemons with Secret Needs
Scripts that automate workflows—such as syncing files, backing up databases, or triggering deployments—often require credentials with limited visibility.

**Benefit:** go-keyring allows these tools to safely access necessary secrets without embedding them directly in code or configuration files.

---

### 5. Testing and Development Environments
Developers can use the mock provider in go-keyring to simulate keyring operations during testing. This accelerates development without requiring a real keyring backend.

```go
keyring.MockInit()
err := keyring.Set("test-service", "tester", "test-password")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
secret, err := keyring.Get("test-service", "tester")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
log.Println("Mocked secret:", secret)
```

**Benefit:** Easily test secret management logic without affecting actual system keyrings.

---

## Why Use go-keyring for Your Use Case?
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Supports macOS, Linux/BSD (via dbus), and Windows without code changes.
- **Native Security:** Uses OS keyrings ensuring secrets reside safely in trusted storage.
- **Simple API:** Minimal and consistent interface abstracts underlying platform complexity.
- **No C Dependencies:** Designed for statically linked binaries common in CLI tools and standalone apps.

---

## Recommendations & Best Practices

- **Use meaningful service and user identifiers:** Organize your secrets logically using service and username keys.
- **Avoid storing overly large secrets:** Platform-imposed size limits exist; keep secrets concise.
- **Test with the mock provider:** Use the built-in mock provider to validate your integration without requiring real keyring access.
- **Handle errors gracefully:** Always check for and handle `ErrNotFound` to provide clear user feedback.

## Troubleshooting Common Scenarios

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common Issues">
<Accordion title="I can't find the default 'login' keyring on Linux">
On many Linux distributions, the default keyring collection in GNOME Keyring is named 'login'. If it doesn't exist, you can create it with Seahorse:

- Open `seahorse` (Passwords and Keys application).
- Go to **File > New > Password Keyring**.
- Name the keyring exactly: `login`.

This ensures go-keyring can connect and store your secrets.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="go-keyring returns ErrNotFound when getting a secret">
This error means the secret does not exist for the specified service and user combination. Make sure you have stored the secret first using `Set` before trying to retrieve it.

Check your service and username strings for typos.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Data length errors when storing secrets">
go-keyring enforces size limits depending on OS. On macOS and Windows, data that's too large will fail. Limit secret sizes:

- macOS combined service, username, and password should be under ~3000 bytes.
- Windows password must not exceed 2560 bytes.

If you need to store larger sensitive data, consider alternative secure storage mechanisms.
